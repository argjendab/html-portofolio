<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a young and ambitious individual with a passion for technology and a drive to learn.
  I am a Student of computer science and engineering in the University of Tetovo,
  I'm also actively expanding my knowledge of coding in web development.
</p>

<p>Beyond academics,
  I find myself invigorated by the world of combat sports
  The discipline and focus required in activities like 
  kickboxing and MMA training resonate with me, pushing me to test my
  limits and build both physical and mental resilience.
  When I'm not training combat sports, then Im probably at the gym
  lifting weights or reading books at Home.
  In essence.

<p>I'm a multifaceted individual with a thirst for knowledge,
  a dedication to personal growth, and a love for exploration,
  both in the digital and the physical world.</p>
